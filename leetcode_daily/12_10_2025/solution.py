# Title: Find Sum of Array Product of Magical Sequences
# Difficulty: Hard
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-sum-of-array-product-of-magical-sequences/
#
# You are given two integers, m and k, and an integer array nums.
# A sequence of integers seq is called magical if:
#
#
# 	seq has a size of m.
# 	0 &lt;= seq[i] &lt; nums.length
# 	The binary representation of 2seq[0] + 2seq[1] + ... + 2seq[m - 1] has k set bits.
#
#
# The array product of this sequence is defined as prod(seq) = (nums[seq[0]] * nums[seq[1]] * ... * nums[seq[m - 1]]).
#
# Return the sum of the array products for all valid magical sequences.
#
# Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
# A set bit refers to a bit in the binary representation of a number that has a value of 1.
