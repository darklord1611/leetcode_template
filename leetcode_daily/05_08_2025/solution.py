class Solution:
    def numOfUnplacedFruits(self, fruits: List[int], baskets: List[int]) -> int:
        # brute force, create a mask of used baskets

        n = len(fruits)

        used = [0 for _ in range(n)]

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if not used[j] and fruits[i] <= baskets[j]:
                    used[j] = 1
                    break

        # unallocated baskets -> number of fruits remain unplaced
        # Time Complexity: O(n^2) -> nested loops
        # Space Complexity: O(n) -> used array to track used baskets

        # We could optimize using segment tree, but too complicate with small inputs
        return n - sum(used)
