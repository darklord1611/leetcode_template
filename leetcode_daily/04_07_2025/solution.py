# Difficulty: Hard
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-ii/
#
# Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = &quot;a&quot;.
#
# You are given a positive integer k. You are also given an integer array operations, where operations[i] represents the type of the ith operation.
#
# Now Bob will ask Alice to perform all operations in sequence:
#
#
# 	If operations[i] == 0, append a copy of word to itself.
# 	If operations[i] == 1, generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word. For example, performing the operation on &quot;c&quot; generates &quot;cd&quot; and performing the operation on &quot;zb&quot; generates &quot;zbac&quot;.
#
#
# Return the value of the kth character in word after performing all the operations.
#
# Note that the character &#39;z&#39; can be changed to &#39;a&#39; in the second type of operation.
#
#


# Your solution starts here
