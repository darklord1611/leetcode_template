# LeetCode Daily Challenge (2025-11-26)\n# Title: Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K\n# Difficulty: Hard\n# Acceptance Rate: 52.00334888171272\n# Tags: Array, Dynamic Programming, Matrix\n# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/paths-in-matrix-whose-sum-is-divisible-by-k/\n#\n# You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix grid and an integer k. You are currently at position (0, 0) and you want to reach position (m - 1, n - 1) moving only down or right.
#
# Return the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by k. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
