# Title: Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two Letter Words
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome-by-concatenating-two-letter-words/
#
# You are given an array of strings words. Each element of words consists of two lowercase English letters.
#
# Create the longest possible palindrome by selecting some elements from words and concatenating them in any order. Each element can be selected at most once.
#
# Return the length of the longest palindrome that you can create. If it is impossible to create any palindrome, return 0.
#
# A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
#
#


# Your solution starts here

        # we can divide words into two types: one type with both character is the same aka "gg" -> type 1
        # other one is with different character aka "ab" or "ba",..... -> type 2
        # suppose we keep track of the count of each word. what type of words should we include first?
        # we only include a word if we able to create and maintain a palindrome
        # that means if we were to insert word x, we would also have to insert word x.reverse()

        # keep track of the frequency of both x and x.reverse(), we can include at most min(freq[x], freq[x.reverse()]) for a word x

                ):  # there can only be one instance of type 1 word in the center
                    max_len += 2

            else:
                max_len += (
                    min(freq[key], freq[key[::-1]]) * 4
                )  # take the min of x and x.reverse()

            freq[key] = 0  # mark as used

        # Time Complexity: O(n)
        # Space Complexity: O(n)
