# Title: Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-i/
#
# You are given a binary array nums.
#
# You can do the following operation on the array any number of times (possibly zero):
#
#
# 	Choose any 3 consecutive elements from the array and flip all of them.
#
#
# Flipping an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.
#
# Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in nums equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.
#
#


# Your solution starts here
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # flipping from left to right -> making sure that the preceding indexes are already satisfied
        # first bit of every flip should be a zero aka [0, 1, 1] -> ok, [1, 0, 1] -> flipping now is not ok
        # only flip leftmost bit if needed -> why? need to prove the correctness
        n = len(nums)
        left = 0
        window_size = 3
        flip_count = 0
        for right in range(n):
            if right - left + 1 == window_size:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    flip_count += 1
                    for i in range(window_size):
                        nums[left + i] = 1 - nums[left + i]

                left += 1

        # check if whether still exists some zeroes in the array -> impossible
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                return -1

        # Time complexity: O(n)
        # Space complexity: O(1)
        return flip_count
