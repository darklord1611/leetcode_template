# LeetCode Daily Challenge (2025-06-27)
# Title: Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times
# Difficulty: Hard
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/
#
# You are given a string s of length n, and an integer k. You are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s.
#
# A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
#
# A subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s, where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.
#
#
# 	For example, &quot;bba&quot; is repeated 2 times in the string &quot;bababcba&quot;, because the string &quot;bbabba&quot;, constructed by concatenating &quot;bba&quot; 2 times, is a subsequence of the string &quot;bababcba&quot;.
#
#
# Return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.
