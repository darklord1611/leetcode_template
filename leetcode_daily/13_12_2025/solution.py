The ith coupon has:
#
#
# 	code[i]: a string representing the coupon identifier.
# 	businessLine[i]: a string denoting the business category of the coupon.
# 	isActive[i]: a boolean indicating whether the coupon is currently active.
#
#
# A coupon is considered valid if all of the following conditions hold:
#
#
# 	code[i] is non-empty and consists only of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (_).
# 	businessLine[i] is one of the following four categories: &quot;electronics&quot;, &quot;grocery&quot;, &quot;pharmacy&quot;, &quot;restaurant&quot;.
# 	isActive[i] is true.
#
#
# Return an array of the codes of all valid coupons, sorted first by their businessLine in the order: &quot;electronics&quot;, &quot;grocery&quot;, &quot;pharmacy&quot;, &quot;restaurant&quot;, and then by code in lexicographical (ascending) order within each category.
