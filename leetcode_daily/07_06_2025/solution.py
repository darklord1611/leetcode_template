# Title: Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-minimum-string-after-removing-stars/
#
# You are given a string s. It may contain any number of &#39;*&#39; characters. Your task is to remove all &#39;*&#39; characters.
#
# While there is a &#39;*&#39;, do the following operation:
#
#
# 	Delete the leftmost &#39;*&#39; and the smallest non-&#39;*&#39; character to its left. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.
#
#
# Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all &#39;*&#39; characters.
#
#


# Your solution starts here

import heapq


class Solution:
    def clearStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        # whenever we encounter a star * -> we must delete a character on the left, the character should be the smallest since we need lexicographically smallest result str
        # the characters after the last star are kept intact
        # we prioritize smaller characters and if they equal, pick the largest one -> save the smaller indices for later stars if possible
        n = len(s)
        heap = []
        res = ""
        used_indices = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] != "*":
                heapq.heappush(heap, (s[i], -i))
            else:
                cur_char, index = heapq.heappop(heap)
                used_indices.add(-index)

        for i in range(n):
            if i not in used_indices and s[i] != "*":
                res += s[i]

        return res
