# Difficulty: Hard
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-ii/
#
# Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.
#
# You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice&#39;s screen. You are also given a positive integer k.
#
# Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size at least k.
#
# Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
#


# Your solution starts here
