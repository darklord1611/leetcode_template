# Title: Distribute Candies Among Children II
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-candies-among-children-ii/
#
# You are given two positive integers n and limit.
# 
# Return the total number of ways to distribute n candies among 3 children such that no child gets more than limit candies.
# 
#  


# Your solution starts here

class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:
        # n candies for 3 children
        # suppose we assign k1 candies to the first child, then we left with n - k1 candies and 2 children
        # do the same, assign k2 candies to the second child, then we left with the third child with n - k1 - k2 candies
        # problem boils down to find all pairs (k1, k2) satisfied k1 <= limit, k2 <= limit, n - (k1 + k2) <= limit, k1 + k2 <= n

        # suppose we give k1 candies to first child, 0 <= k1 <= min(n, limit)
        # then we left with n - k1 candies for the other two remaining children
        # assign k2 candies -> 0 <= k2 <= limit, k1 + k2 <= n -> 0 <= k2 <= min(n - k1, limit)
        # third child gets n - k1 - k2 candies, 0 <= n - k1 - k2 <= limit -> n - k1 - limit <= k2 <= n - k1
        # so for each k1, the valid choices for k2 would be max(0, n - k1 - limit) <= k2 <= min(n - k1, limit)
        if n > 3 * limit:
            return 0
        total_ways = 0

        for k1 in range(0, min(n, limit) + 1):
            left_bound = max(0, n - k1 - limit)
            right_bound = min(n - k1, limit)

            valid_choices = right_bound - left_bound + 1
            if valid_choices > 0: # exist valid pairs
                total_ways += valid_choices
            
        # Time Complexity: O(n)
        # Space Complexity: O(1)
        return total_ways
