# Your solution starts here

from itertools import combinations
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def largestTriangleArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        # Shoelace's formula

        def calc_triangle_area(a, b, c):
            return 0.5 * abs(
                a[0] * (b[1] - c[1]) + b[0] * (c[1] - a[1]) + c[0] * (a[1] - b[1])
            )

        max_area = 0
        for a, b, c in combinations(points, 3):
            cur_area = calc_triangle_area(a, b, c)
            max_area = max(max_area, cur_area)

        # Time complexity: O(n^3)
        # Space complexity: O(1)
        return max_area
