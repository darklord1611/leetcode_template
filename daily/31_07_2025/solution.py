# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-ors-of-subarrays/
#
# Given an integer array arr, return the number of distinct bitwise ORs of all the non-empty subarrays of arr.
#
# The bitwise OR of a subarray is the bitwise OR of each integer in the subarray. The bitwise OR of a subarray of one integer is that integer.
#
# A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
