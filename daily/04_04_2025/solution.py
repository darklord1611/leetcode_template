# Title: Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
# 
# Recall that:
# 
# 
# 	The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
# 	The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
# 	The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.
# 
# 
#
