# Title: Sum of k-Mirror Numbers
# Difficulty: Hard
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-k-mirror-numbers/
#
# A k-mirror number is a positive integer without leading zeros that reads the same both forward and backward in base-10 as well as in base-k.
#
#
# 	For example, 9 is a 2-mirror number. The representation of 9 in base-10 and base-2 are 9 and 1001 respectively, which read the same both forward and backward.
# 	On the contrary, 4 is not a 2-mirror number. The representation of 4 in base-2 is 100, which does not read the same both forward and backward.
#
#
# Given the base k and the number n, return the sum of the n smallest k-mirror numbers.
