# Title: Count the Number of Arrays with K Matching Adjacent Elements
# Difficulty: Hard
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-arrays-with-k-matching-adjacent-elements/
#
# You are given three integers n, m, k. A good array arr of size n is defined as follows:
#
#
# 	Each element in arr is in the inclusive range [1, m].
# 	Exactly k indices i (where 1 &lt;= i &lt; n) satisfy the condition arr[i - 1] == arr[i].
#
#
# Return the number of good arrays that can be formed.
#
# Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
