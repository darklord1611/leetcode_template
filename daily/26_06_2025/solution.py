# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/
#
# You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.
#
# Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.
#
# Note:
#
#
# 	The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
# 	The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
# 	A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
