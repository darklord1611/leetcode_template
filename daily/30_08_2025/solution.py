# LeetCode Daily Challenge (2025-08-30)
# Title: Valid Sudoku
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/
#
# Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
#
#
# 	Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# 	Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# 	Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# 	A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
# 	Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
