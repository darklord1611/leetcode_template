        # the string t is essentially a stack

        # so essentially we wants to push the current character into the result if it is the smallest, compare to other future characters
        # at each character we need to know whether the top element of the stack is the smallest?
        # if yes then just push to result, else keep add elements to the stack

        min_suffix = [s[i] for i in range(n)]

        )  # ensure that the last character is already minimum
