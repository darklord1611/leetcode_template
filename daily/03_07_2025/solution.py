# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-i/
#
# Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = &quot;a&quot;.
# 
# You are given a positive integer k.
# 
# Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:
# 
# 
# 	Generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.
# 
# 
# For example, performing the operation on &quot;c&quot; generates &quot;cd&quot; and performing the operation on &quot;zb&quot; generates &quot;zbac&quot;.
# 
# Return the value of the kth character in word, after enough operations have been done for word to have at least k characters.
# 
# Note that the character &#39;z&#39; can be changed to &#39;a&#39; in the operation.
# 
#  


# Your solution starts here
