# Title: Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-with-maximum-bitwise-and/
#
# You are given an integer array nums of size n.
#
# Consider a non-empty subarray from nums that has the maximum possible bitwise AND.
#
#
# 	In other words, let k be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of any subarray of nums. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to k should be considered.
#
#
# Return the length of the longest such subarray.
#
# The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.
#
# A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
#

class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # bitwise AND only decrease the value, -> the value# will be maximum when we have the maximum number in the arrays
        # just count the consecutive occurrences of the maximum number in the array
        n = len(nums)
        max_num = max(nums)

        cur_count = 0
        max_count = 0

        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] == max_num:
                cur_count += 1
                max_count = max(max_count, cur_count)
            else:
                cur_count = 0

        # Time Complexity: O(n) -> single pass through the array
        # Space Complexity: O(1) -> no extra space used
        return max_count
