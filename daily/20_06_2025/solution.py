# Title: Maximum Manhattan Distance After K Changes
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-manhattan-distance-after-k-changes/
#
# You are given a string s consisting of the characters &#39;N&#39;, &#39;S&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, and &#39;W&#39;, where s[i] indicates movements in an infinite grid:
# 
# 
# 	&#39;N&#39; : Move north by 1 unit.
# 	&#39;S&#39; : Move south by 1 unit.
# 	&#39;E&#39; : Move east by 1 unit.
# 	&#39;W&#39; : Move west by 1 unit.
# 
# 
# Initially, you are at the origin (0, 0). You can change at most k characters to any of the four directions.
# 
# Find the maximum Manhattan distance from the origin that can be achieved at any time while performing the movements in order.
# The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
#  


# Your solution starts here
