# LeetCode Daily Challenge (2025-05-22)
# Title: Zero Array Transformation III
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-iii/
#
# You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries where queries[i] = [li, ri].
#
# Each queries[i] represents the following action on nums:
#
#
# 	Decrement the value at each index in the range [li, ri] in nums by at most 1.
# 	The amount by which the value is decremented can be chosen independently for each index.
#
#
# A Zero Array is an array with all its elements equal to 0.
#
# Return the maximum number of elements that can be removed from queries, such that nums can still be converted to a zero array using the remaining queries. If it is not possible to convert nums to a zero array, return -1.
#
#


# Your solution starts here
from typing import List
import heapq


class Solution:
    def maxRemoval(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # how many queries needed to make the first element satisfied? nums[0] queries with left endpoints be nums[0]
        # notice that we want to process queries to make the first element valid before moving onto to the second element -> sort the queries according to the start index
        # suppose we already have k queries that include current number, which one should we prioritize? the ones with larger ending indices -> cover more numbers -> use max heap to store valid queries for an index

        # how to keep track of the number of operations needed to make the current number and potential future numbers valid? -> difference array

        queries.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        heap = []
        deltaArray = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
        operations = 0
        j = 0
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # reset the number of operations needed to make the current number valid
            # first part would be the number of valid ranges (processed by previous number at index i - 1) that actually include the current number (we resuse this) + the (negative) count of invalid ranges that actually ends at index - 1 and leaves index i untouched
            operations = operations + deltaArray[i]

            # process and store all the queries that do have an effect on the current number
            while j < len(queries) and queries[j][0] <= i:
                heapq.heappush(heap, -queries[j][1])
                j += 1

            # greedily take the queries with larger ending indices
            while operations < num and heap and -heap[0] >= i:
                operations += 1

                # update the index next to the right bound of the query. For example if a query ends at index i, then we know that value at index i + 1 is untouched, therefore the number of operations should be restored to the original
                deltaArray[-heapq.heappop(heap) + 1] -= 1
            if operations < num:
                return -1

        # Time Complexity: O(n + m * log(m))
        # Space Complexity: O(n + m)

        # current elements in the heap are the unused queries
        return len(heap)
