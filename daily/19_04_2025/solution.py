# Title: Count the Number of Fair Pairs
# Difficulty: Medium
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-fair-pairs/
#
# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n and two integers lower and upper, return the number of fair pairs.
# 
# A pair (i, j) is fair if:
# 
# 
# 	0 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt; n, and
# 	lower &lt;= nums[i] + nums[j] &lt;= upper
# 
# 
#  


# Your solution starts here
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countFairPairs(self, nums: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:
        # does order between numbers matter? what if we switch place of i and j?
        # we want the count and not the exact indexes
        # suppose the number is sorted, what happen if a pair (i, j) is valid with i << j? Think about the pairs in-between
        # lower <= ... <= high -> can we simplify this condition? -> 0 <= ... <= high + 1 would contains everything we need + some extras -> extras? just substract counts from 0 <= ... <= lower -> done
        pair_count = 0
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()

        def lower_bound(val):
            left = 0
            right = n - 1
            res = 0
            while left < right:
                target_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
                if target_sum < val:
                    res += right - left
                    left += 1
                else:
                    right -= 1
            
            return res
        
        return lower_bound(upper + 1) - lower_bound(lower)
