# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-valid-subsequence-ii/
#
# You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k.
# A subsequence sub of nums with length x is called valid if it satisfies:
#
#
# 	(sub[0] + sub[1]) % k == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % k == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % k.
#
# Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of nums.
#


# Your solution starts here
