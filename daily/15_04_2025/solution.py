# Title: Count Good Triplets in an Array
# Difficulty: Hard
# URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-triplets-in-an-array/
#
# You are given two 0-indexed arrays nums1 and nums2 of length n, both of which are permutations of [0, 1, ..., n - 1].
#
# A good triplet is a set of 3 distinct values which are present in increasing order by position both in nums1 and nums2. In other words, if we consider pos1v as the index of the value v in nums1 and pos2v as the index of the value v in nums2, then a good triplet will be a set (x, y, z) where 0 &lt;= x, y, z &lt;= n - 1, such that pos1x &lt; pos1y &lt; pos1z and pos2x &lt; pos2y &lt; pos2z.
#
# Return the total number of good triplets.
